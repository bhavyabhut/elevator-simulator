# üöÄ Elevator Simulator

Welcome to the **Elevator Simulator**, a dynamic simulation of elevator movements, complete with real-time updates and control panel interactions.

This project features a **React** front-end with **Tailwind CSS**, **TypeScript**, and **Framer Motion**, and a **Node.js** back-end powered by **Express** and **MongoDB** for managing elevator states. The simulator provides a visual representation of an elevator moving between floors, with smooth animations and real-time API interaction.

## üñ•Ô∏è Project Overview

- **Front-End**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- **Back-End**: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, REST API
- **Deployment**: Front-end on **Netlify**, back-end on **Render**

### üåü Features

- Interactive **control panel** for calling the elevator to specific floors.
- Real-time **elevator movement** and status updates.
- **Responsive** design for mobile and desktop.
- Visually appealing animations using **Framer Motion**.
- REST API for managing elevator states.

## üöÄ Live Demo

- **Frontend**: [Elevator Simulator on Netlify](https://elevator-bhavya.netlify.app/)
- **Backend**: Hosted on Render (see note below).

> **Note**: The backend is hosted on a free-tier Render service. This means the server may take a few minutes to wake up when accessing the application for the first time.
